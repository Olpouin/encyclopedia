# Gallery
The gallery is a simple way to make Wikipedia-style informative pages about anything you want.

**Coming features :**
- Admin panel
- Huge code improvement ~~pls don't look now, unless you want an heart attack~~
- Better privacy features
  - Proxy for images/sounds/videos instead of linking directly to other servers
  - Ability to disable YouTube videos for users, as there's no (practical) way to not link to Google's servers.

## Why use this?

I created this because I wanted to be able to store informations about a personal roleplay on a wiki website but every websites were full of useless features and accounts. The Gallery only have the main page and the pages you create. Nothing more. It also use a simple design to combine usefull and nice looking pages.

## How do I use this?

At first, you should take a look at `config.php`. The only things you *have to* change is the "database" configuration, and certainly the "types" configuration.  
You can edit everything by just adding `&edit` at the end of the URL: every card has its own password and you can use one global password.
